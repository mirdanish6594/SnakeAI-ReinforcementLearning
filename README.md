# Snake AI - Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play Snake using Q-learning. The agent's goal is to maximize its score while avoiding collisions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- Pygame
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

### Running

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python agent.py` for training.
3. Monitor training and view real-time plots.

## Customization

Adjust hyperparameters in `agent.py` for optimization.

## Project Structure

- `game.py`: Snake game environment.
- `agent.py`: AI agent using Q-learning.
- `model.py`: Neural network for Q-values.
- `game_plot.py`: Real-time training progress plots.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Follow GitHub guidelines.
